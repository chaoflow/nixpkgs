This branch (``python``) is home of a [nixpkgs testing](./tests)
approach using [nixtest](https://github.com/chaoflow/nixtest) as
testrunner and wheel-based [python
packaging](./pkgs/development/python-wheels/CONCEPT.org).

This branch is not meant to be merged into master and expected to
experience rebasing. There will be specific pull requests once the new
wheel-based python packaging stabilizes.
