The (``python``) branch is home of wheel-based [python
packaging](./pkgs/development/python-wheels/CONCEPT.org) and
experimental [nixpkgs testing](./tests) using
[nixtest](https://github.com/chaoflow/nixtest) as test driver.

This branch is not meant to be merged into master and expected to
experience rebasing. There will be specific pull requests once things
stabilize.

Hydra builds the branch as the
[python-rework](http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/python-rework)
jobset.
